Background Image (Top/Hero)
- Your site uses: assets/hero-bg.jpg (desktop) and assets/hero-bg-mobile.jpg (mobile).
- To use YOUR Minecraft screenshot as the hero background:
  1) Save your image as: hero-bg.jpg
  2) Put it in the assets/ folder, replacing the existing file.
  3) (Optional but recommended) make a mobile crop named: hero-bg-mobile.jpg (1080x1350-ish)
     and replace that too.
- Tip: Keep the horizon near the top third so text stays readable on phones.

Quick Start
- Open index.html in a browser.
- Edit links in script.js if needed.
